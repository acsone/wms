============
Stock Refill
============

Compute the priority to:
- arrange a product (move from reception parking to bin)
- reassort a product (move from reserve to bin)

We consider the fact of being out of stock as urgent, the risk of being out of
stock in the coming days as medium.

The risk is computed based on an amount of days to cover with current stock and
a mean consumption on the last 6 months.
