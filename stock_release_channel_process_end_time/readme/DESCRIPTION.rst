When managing deliveries through a release channel two main issues are faced:

- You expect to view the stock pickings in the same order as the the one you
  have set as process end date on the release channel. This way you can easily
  manage the deliveries in the same order as the one expected by the planned
  release channels.

- You expect to set as deadline of your released move operations the process
  end date of the release channel. This is useful to ensure that move created
  when releasing deliveries get the same deadline as the one set on the
  release channel. This is also required to allow the merge of move operations
  generated for the same product, location in the same stock picking.

This module solves these issues.
